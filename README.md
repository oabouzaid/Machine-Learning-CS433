## Project 1 Machine Learning @ EPFL ##

This directory includes all of the files for our project 1 submission. Our team members are Gaurav Pasari (gaurav.pasari@epfl.ch), Karunya Tota (karunya.tota@epfl.ch), and Oussama Abouzaid (oussama.abouzaid@epfl.ch). Our name on Kaggle is 'Logistic Depression'. We achieved a final accuracy of 0.83035 on the leaderboard.

* **run.py**: This script runs our implentation for training the model and generating the labels for the testing dataset. In order to run this file, simply enter 'python run.py' on your terminal. A new file 'output.csv' should be created in the same directory containing the labels that we have submitted on the Kaggle page.

* **implentations.py**: This file contains our implementations for the functions mentioned in the project guidlines (least_square_GD, least_square_SGD, least_squares, ridge_regression, logistic_regression, reg_logistic_regression). The corresponding helper functions for these methods are also included.

* **proj1_helpers.py**: This file contains the original helpers provided to the class that allow us to load input csv files, generate predictions from weights, and create a csv submission.
