**Important:**
<br />
Prior to running the code, please indicate the location of the training data and testing data in the run.py script. The variables are specified as TRAINING_DATA and TEST_DATA.

* **run.py**: This script runs our implentation for training the model and generating the labels for the testing dataset. In order to run this file, enter 'python run.py' on your terminal. Make sure you have the same version of Python as Jupyter notebook otherwise result may vary. Jupyter uses 3.6.3. A new file 'output.csv' should be created in the same directory containing the labels that we have submitted on the Kaggle page.

* **implementations.py**: This file contains our implementations for the functions mentioned in the project guidlines (least_square_GD, least_square_SGD, least_squares, ridge_regression, logistic_regression, reg_logistic_regression). The required helper functions for the implementations of these methods are also included.

* **proj1_helpers.py**: This file contains the original helpers provided to the class that allow us to load input csv files, generate predictions from weights, and create a csv submission.
